# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

This project is a step by step process of building a real estate price prediction algorithm using the Bengaluru dataset from kaggle.com. We will first build a model using sklearn and linear regression. During model building I used data load and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tunning, k fold cross validation etc. Technology and tools wise this project covers:

Python
Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
Matplotlib for data visualization
Sklearn for model building
Jupyter notebook, visual studio code and pycharm as IDE
